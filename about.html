			</div>
					<p class="about">Matt Moffett is a visual artist and educator born in California and currently located in
					Oklahoma. He was inspired to become an artist when he was twenty-six years old and teaching
					Advanced Conversational Spanish at a university when his dog suffered from a fatal brain
					aneurysm that left him grieving and longing for a portrait of his beloved pet. When he could not
					find any artist in Oklahoma to paint the portrait, he decided to do it himself, and has been painting ever since.</p>
					<p class="about">In addition to teaching Spanish, Moffett had also previously worked in several other jobs
					including, but not limited to, a public art teacher, an Executive Director of a 501(c)(3) non profit
					art school, and an International Procurement Manager for an international petroleum engineering
					firm. As a true patron of learning and accessibility, Moffett’s passion for teaching led him to
					starting a non profit art school for underserved children after having taught publicly in the
					poorest elementary schools in his city. After 25-years of teaching, he believes that his students
					have had an extraordinarily positive influence on his art and who he is as a person. However,
					once he made the shift to being solely a visual artist, he made it a priority to never stop letting
					himself create. Though the road to becoming a full time artist can be challenging, after 22 years
					of being an oil portraitist, Moffett is able to make a living only by selling his art.
					Moffett’s work can be found in 18 countries and his multifaceted artistic abilities have led
					him to several unique projects outside of oil portraits. In 2020-2021, he created 9 smalti mosaic
					colonnade sculptures depicting Oklahoma flora and fauna, topped with authentic Cherokee
					beading patterns for a shopping center across the street from Google’s Oklahoma location.
					Moffett also welded a 25-foot tall installation of the Oklahoma state bird, the Scissor Tailed
					FlyCatcher, out of recycled tractor parts and architectural oddities, as well as two 20-foot
						columns out of rebar for wisteria to grow on.</p>
					<p class="about">In any non commissioned artwork that he makes, Moffett includes a depiction of an
					umbrella somewhere within it. The umbrella is a symbol of protection and Moffett views it also a
					sign of God saying “It’s all gonna work out fine.” When he was teaching in India, Moffett also
					discovered that the Hindu Priests of Varanasi use an umbrella as their symbol of protection as
						well.</p>
					<p class="about">Moffett describes his work as “Loose Magic Realism” that creates beauty and hope. His
					art is made to always be colorful, whimsical, and magical. When asked about how he hopes his
					art is received by viewers, he replied, “To make them happy. To heal the viewer. To give repose
					and wonder, like a magic looking glass, to the viewer. To make them pause a moment and really
					enjoy the thousands of brushstrokes, glass tiles or pieces of welded metal that is playing a visual
					symphony for the eyes.”</p>

						<p class="hobby-text">Moffett is passionate about travel and discovering new ways to create art. His ventures
						include several dreamy destinations such as India, Spain, Hungary, and more! Moffett’s
						wonderful husband, John, often accompanies him on his adventures and they spent their magical
						honeymoon in the Amalfi Coast in Italy. Moffett also continues to master his craft as a visual
						artist by picking up new skills whenever he can in various mediums, such as glass blowing and
						learning about new ways to display his work on social media. He is constantly finding inspiration
						in magazines, antique books, TikTok, and museum excursions. His hope moving forward is that
						he can continue to grow and better his art and leave behind a wonderful legacy.</p>
